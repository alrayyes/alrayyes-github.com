Welcome all. I've decided to start a new blog from scratch because that's what all the cool kids seem to be doing. What to expect? Well I'm you're average computer geek so with a bit of luck the following subjects will probably pop up:

Programming
Computer Security
Linux
BSD
Esxi
Movies
Anime
Books
General news that interests me

Expect a bit of everything I suppose.
